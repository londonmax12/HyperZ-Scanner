# üöÄ HyperZ Vulnerability Scanner
HyperZ is a work-in-progress web application vulnerability scanner designed to crawl through a website and identify potential security issues. It can be used to discover sensitive information disclosure, and other common vulnerabilities.
## üì• Installation
1. Clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/londonmax12/hyperz-scanner
```
2. Install required dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1. Run the scanner using the following command
```
python hyperz.py -u <url> [-d <depth>] [-v] [-p <proxy_list>] [-g] [-t <timeout>] [-o <output_file>]

```
2. View results in the specified report file generated
### ‚öôÔ∏è Command Options
- -u, --url <url>: URL to scan (required).
- -d, --depth <depth>: Depth limit for crawling (default: 5).
- -v, --verbose: Enable verbose output.
- --p, --proxy_list <proxy_list>: File that contains a list of proxies to use.
- -g, --get_proxies: Get proxies to use from: https://www.sslproxies.org/.
- -t, --timeout <timeout>: Timeout on website requests (default: 5).
- -o, --output_file <output_file>: Specify the output file for the report (default: report.json).
### Example
Scan example.com with a depth limit of 3 and save the report to "output.json":
```
python hyperz.py -u http://example.com -d 3 -o output.json
```
## Development Roadmap
